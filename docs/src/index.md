# Annotated Reading of the **Vue.js Components Fundamentals** Course of the *Vue School*

These are my notes written in pandoc markdown [@casiano] from watching the [@vuejsfundamentals] and 
[@vuejscomponentsfundamentals]  courses and other [references](#references).


These notes have been ellaborated using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to translate it the markdown to HTML.

At the current time (December 2021), this notes are experimental, since the HTML generated by pandoc has some incompatibilities with Vue and I had to resort to some awful tricks to made them work.


1. I'm using the [pandoc-include](https://github.com/DCsunset/pandoc-include) filter
2. The citation styles have been taken from [@citationstyles].
3. The HTML generation is reached using [@pandoc-toc-sidebar],
   a Pandoc HTML template that  has a navbar on the top of the page for website navigation, and a TOC (table of contents) on the sidebar for page navigation

To see the result, you can 

1. Open the deployment in the  GitHub pages <https://crguezl.github.io/learning-vue-geting-started-guide/> of the repo [crguezl/learning-vue-geting-started-guide](https://github.com/crguezl/learning-vue-geting-started-guide) containing the notes or
2. To install it locally, fork the repo. You have to have `pandoc` installed and  then
   1. Run `npm install-pandoc-dependencies` to install `pandoc-include` 
   2. Run `npm start` to compile the sources and open the resulting `index.html` file. 

[You can download the pdf version of this document here](index.pdf) or by clicking in the left upper corner.

## The goals. Workflow

We have three branches in this repo

1. `main` has the initial structure
2. `solution` has the final solution developed by the authors of the course
3. `teacher` is the branch I used when I took the course

Use the `main` branch while you take the course
