This are my notes written in markdown from reading the guide of Vue.js (v2) [@vuestart] 

They have been ellaborated using pandoc.
At the current time (December 2021), this notes are experimental, since the HTML generated by pandoc has some incompatibilities with Vue.

To see the result, you can open the deployment in the  GitHub pages <https://crguezl.github.io/learning-vue-geting-started-guide/> of the repo containing the notes.
